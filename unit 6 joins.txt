1.the first example shows the goal scored by a player with the last name 'Bender'. The * says to list all the columns in the table - a shorter way of saying matchid, teamid, player, gtime
Modify it to show the matchid and player name for all goals scored by Germany. To identify German players, check for: teamid = 'GER'

ans=select matchid,player from goal 
	where teamid='GER'

2.From the previous query you can see that Lars Bender's scored a goal in game 1012. Now we want to know what teams were playing in that match.
Notice in the that the column matchid in the goal table corresponds to the id column in the game table. We can look up information about game 1012 by finding that row in the game table.
Show id, stadium, team1, team2 for just game 1012
ans=SELECT id,stadium,team1,team2
  FROM game where id=1012

3.Modify it to show the player, teamid, stadium and mdate for every German goal.
ans=SELECT go.player,go.teamid,g.stadium,g.mdate FROM game as g JOIN goal as go ON id=matchid where teamid='GER'

4.Use the same JOIN as in the previous question.
Show the team1, team2 and player for every goal scored by a player called Mario player LIKE 'Mario%'
ans=SELECT g.team1,g.team2,go.player FROM game as g JOIN goal as go ON id=matchid where player like 'Mario%'

5.The table eteam gives details of every national team including the coach. You can JOIN goal to eteam using the phrase goal JOIN eteam on teamid=id
Show player, teamid, coach, gtime for all goals scored in the first 10 minutes gtime<=10
ans=select player,teamid,coach,gtime from goal 
as g join eteam as e on teamid=id where gtime<=10

6.List the dates of the matches and the name of the team in which 'Fernando Santos' was the team1 coach.
ans=select mdate,teamname from game 
join eteam on team1=eteam.id
where coach='Fernando Santos'

7.List the player for every goal scored in a game where the stadium was 'National Stadium, Warsaw'
ans=select go.player from game as g
join goal as go on id=matchid where stadium= 'National Stadium, Warsaw'

8.The example query shows all goals scored in the Germany-Greece quarterfinal.
Instead show the name of all players who scored a goal against Germany.
ans=select distinct player
from goal as go join game as ga on go.matchid = ga.id
where (team1 = 'ger' or team2 = 'ger')
  and go.teamid != 'ger'

9.Show teamname and the total number of goals scored.
ans=select teamname,count(teamid) from goal join eteam 
on id=teamid group by teamname;

10.Show the stadium and the number of goals scored in each stadium.
ans=select stadium,count(teamid) from game join goal on id=matchid
group by stadium;

11.For every match involving 'POL', show the matchid, date and the number of goals scored.
ans=SELECT matchid,mdate,count(teamid)
  from game join goal on matchid = id 
 where (team1 = 'POL' or team2 = 'POL')
group by matchid,mdate;

12.For every match where 'GER' scored, show matchid, match date and the number of goals scored by 'GER'
ans=select matchid,mdate,count(teamid) from game join goal 
on matchid=id where teamid= 'ger'
group by matchid,mdate;
