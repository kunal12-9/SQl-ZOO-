1.List each country name where the population is larger than that of 'Russia'.
ans=SELECT name FROM world
  WHERE population >
     (SELECT population FROM world
      WHERE name='Russia')

2.Show the countries in Europe with a per capita GDP greater than 'United Kingdom'.
ans=select name from world where continent= 'europe' and gdp/population>
(select gdp/population from world where name='united kingdom')

3.List the name and continent of countries in the continents containing either Argentina or Australia. Order by name of the country.
ans=select name, continent from world
 where continent =any(select continent
 from world where name in ('argentina', 'australia'))order by name;

4.Which country has a population that is more than United Kingdom but less than Germany? Show the name and the population.
ans=select name , population from world where population>
(select population from world where name='united kingdom')
and population<(select population from world where name='Germany')



6.Which countries have a GDP greater than every country in Europe? [Give the name only.] (Some countries may have NULL gdp values)
answer=select name from world where gdp >all
(select gdp from world where continent='europe'
and gdp is not null)

7.Find the largest country (by area) in each continent, show the continent, the name and the area
The above example is known as a correlated or synchronized sub-query.
ans=SELECT continent, name, area FROM world as x
  WHERE area >= ALL
    (SELECT area FROM world y
        WHERE y.continent=x.continent
          AND area>0)

8.List each continent and the name of the country that comes first alphabetically.
ans=select continent,name from world as w1 where name =
(select min(name) from world as w2 where w1.continent=w2.continent)

9.select name,continent,population from world
where continent =any
(select continent from world group by continent having max(population)<=25000000)
